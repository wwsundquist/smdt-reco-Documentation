# Getting started

## Introduction
This code is designed by the ATLAS groups at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Michigan to reconstruct raw data files from MDT test chambers.

## Installation Guide
Clone the repository: **repo address**. Dependancies: CMake, ROOR, **...?**

## Building the code
To build the code, run
````
cd smdt_reco/
source setup.sh
cd ./build/
make -j10
cd ../
````
You may find it helpful to save these commands to a shell script in the ````smdt_reco/```` directory.

## Getting raw data

## Running the code
After building there will be several executables in you build area. The setup script creates aliases for these so they may be run quickly. These areâ€”
````
./build/decodeRawData --conf ./conf/<your-file>.conf
````
````
./build/doT0Fit --conf ./conf/<your-file>.conf
./build/autoCalibration --conf ./conf/<your-file>.conf
./build/residuals --conf ./conf/<your-file>.conf
````
Finds difference between tracks predicted distance and the R(t) curve distance.
````
./build/residuals -h --conf ./conf/<your-file>.conf
````
Finds the residual for each hit based on track fitted without that hit. Should be N times slower. 
````
./build/efficiency --conf ./conf/<your-file>.conf
````
Choose the appropriate configuration file ````<your-file>.conf```` to your run.

### Data format
Data formats related to signal type, it's a cypher to decode the words in the packet. Value should be one of these strings (w/o quotes!)
Legacy formats
  "AMT"
  "HPTDC"
    Kevin was using this 6 yrs ago.
Modern formats
  "Phase2"
    most common, miniDAQ or any DAQ collects data in this format
  "FELIX"
    format for HL LHC
  You'll know if you put it in wrong, code immediately exits for not one of these strings. src/reco/Signal.cxx
  Used in decodeRawData

### AutoCalibration
Can choose chebyshev or polynomial interpolation. Piecewise does not work. used when fitting the R(t) curve
